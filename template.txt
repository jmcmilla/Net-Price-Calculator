            <h2>Expected Family Contribution</h2>

            <p>

                To use this Award Estimator, you will be required to visit the <a href="https://fafsa4caster.ed.gov/F4CApp/spring/login?locale=" target="_blank">FAFSA4caster</a> website to obtain your <strong>Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</strong>.

                This is <strong>NOT</strong> what your family will actually be contributing, but rather a calculation as to what your family is expected to contribute.  This process takes approximately 30 minutes.<br>

                <br>

                <em>Note: An EFC Value of zero (0) will result in the most discounted tuition rate</em>

		<h2>Net Price Summary</h2>
       	<p>

			This estimate of an award is based on a student <strong><RESIDENCYLABEL/></strong>, having an EFC of <strong><EFCVALUE/></strong>, 

            and matching the criteria of <strong><PROFILELABEL/></strong>.

            Any changes in the data elements you had to provide on the FASFA4caster will likely calculate a different EFC and a

            different award.

        </p>

        <p>

            The award estimate is based upon our most recent packaging parameters and federal/state appropriations.  

            Any future changes made by the federal government to the methodology used to calculate the EFC and/or

            federal/state appropriations for the funds listed could result in a different award.  Also, any scholarships you are

            awarded would need to be considered as part of your award and could reduce the award.

			Kettering University: An Affordable Education that Works! Transportation and miscellaneous costs are included in total cost of attendance recognizing "reasonable costs" associated with your co-op placement.  Costs are unique to particular co-op experiences and many students will incur lower co-op related expenses. On average, students earn $40,000 - $65,000 over the course of the program. Wages earned from co-op or other experiential learning experiences exceed co-op related expenses, and excess earnings may be applied to your educational costs above and beyond all sources of financial aid.
